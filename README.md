# LGMVI-Task1

# Iris Flowers Classification ML Project

This project is commonly referred to as the "Hello World" of Machine Learning. The Iris flowers dataset contains numeric attributes, making it perfect for beginners to learn about supervised ML algorithms, specifically how to load and handle data. The small size of the dataset allows it to fit in memory without requiring special transformations or scaling capabilities.

## Dataset

The dataset can be fetched using the `ucimlrepo` library from the following link: [Iris Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/53/iris)


## Project Structure

- `iris.ipynb`: This is the main Python script for the project.

## Dependencies

The project requires the following libraries:

- `ucimlrepo`
- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `scikit-learn`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`

You can install these dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install ucimlrepo numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
